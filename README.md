# Rules for writing good code

- Code should be short, but not at the cost of readability
- Names of things (variables, functions, etc.) should be descriptive
- Names of things (variables, functions, etc.) should be short, but not at the cost of readability or descriptiveness
- Code is like a joke: If you need to explain it, it's not good
- Never ever hard-code values that are likely to change (they all are)
- Minimise indenting, it makes code harder to read
- Check all your inputs at the start of each a function to amke sure the function can run sucessfully, otherwise return
- Avoid using generic variable names
- When using generic variable names, follow convention
- Organise your code consistently, preferably top-to-bottom
- Each piece of code should do one thing and only one, and do it well
- Names of things should be consistent throughout your codebase (and across related codebases)
- When calling a piece of code from another piece of code, don't assume it will run successfully&mdash;program defensively
